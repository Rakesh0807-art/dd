                The IoT-based windmill parameter monitoring system was successfully 
                implemented and tested in a real-world scenario. The system was able to collect 
                data on various parameters such as temperature, humidity, pressure, rain 
                detection, and object detection with distance. The collected data was then 
                analyzed to identify any potential faults or issues with the windmill. The results 
                obtained from the monitoring system were compared to the expected 
                outcomes, and the system was found to be highly accurate in detecting faults 
                and potential issues. The system was able to monitor the windmill parameters 
                in real-time and send alerts to the maintenance team when necessary.

             <p class="text-l">
             The deployment of an IoT
             based windmill parameter monitoring system is an important step towards 
             offering dependable and cost-effective energy generation. The system's 
             many benefits make it an appealing alternative for windmill monitoring 
             and maintenance. As more wind energy producing projects are created 
             throughout the world, the usage of IoT-based monitoring systems for 
             windmills is projected to grow in the future years. <br><br>Overall, the IoT-based 
             windmill parameter monitoring system has shown to be a very effective 
             and dependable method of monitoring windmill parameters. It has the 
             ability to save operating costs, boost efficiency, and improve safety, 
             ultimately contributing to the creation of sustainable energy. 
             <br><br>In conclusion, the implementation of the IoT-based windmill parameter 
             monitoring system has numerous benefits, including remote monitoring, 
             reduced operating costs, increased efficiency, improved safety, and 
             reduced downtime for maintenance work. The system is able to detect 
             potential faults and disasters, and the collected data can be used to identify 
             the reason for the gap between the actual performance outcome of the 
             machine and the expected outcome.
